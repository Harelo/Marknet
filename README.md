*Marknet is a project that was made for my 12th grade finales. It is a not a real website.
Marknet is an ASP.NET website where you can purchase supermarket items online which will then be delivered to your home.
This repository also includes two ASP.NET web-services.
All the information needed to understand this project can be found in the Hebrew-written project book included in this repository.
